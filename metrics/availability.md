Availability defines the proportion of time that the system is functional and working.
It can be measured as a percentage of the total system downtime over a predefined period.
Availability is affected by system errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks, and system load.

# Metrics
- Availability (not including planned downtime): % 
- Planned downtime: # of mins per day/week/month;
- Time required to update software/hardware on the running system: # of mins
- Graceful degradation(Auto restart, check if it correct place): yes/no 

# Examples
- Availability %: 99.99% (not including planned downtime)
- Planned downtime: 60 min/week
- Time required to update software/hardware on the running system: 20 min
- Graceful degradation(Auto restart, check if it correct place): yes
