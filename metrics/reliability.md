# Reliability

Reliability is the ability of a system to remain operational over time.
Reliability is measured as the probability that a system will not fail to perform its intended functions over a
specified time interval.

# Metrics
- Failure rate. The frequency with which an engineered system or component fails, expressed in failures per unit of time.
- MTTF. The average time from start of operation until the time when the first failure occurs.
- MTTR. A measure of the average time required to restore a failing component to operation.
- MTBF. The time from the start of operation until the component is restored to operation after repair.
- Time to switch to disaster recovery environment: # of secs
- Number of severity Critical and High customer-reported bugs: #
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service.
  This determines what is considered an acceptable time window when service is unavailable.): # sec
- Recover Point Objective (RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point.
  This determines what is considered an acceptable loss of data between the last recovery point and the interruption
  of service): # sec
