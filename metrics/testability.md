# Testability

Testability is a measure of how easy it is to create test criteria for the system and its components,
and to execute these tests in order to determine if the criteria are met.
Good testability makes it more likely that faults in a system can be isolated in a timely and effective manner.

# Metrics

- Unit tests coverage: percentage
- Integration tests coverage: percentage
- Exact list of required test environments (functional testing env., performance testing env., security testing env., etc.) ): list
- Exact list of test approaches to be used (manual/automated, unit, end-2-end, regression, integration): list
- Test data for automated test: prod like/artificial

# Example metrics
- Unit-test coverage for all sources: >= 80%
- Integration test coverage for API methods: 100%
- Content regression tests: 80% of stylesheets (XSLT 2.0) are covered (to be researched)
- Integration tests for simulated customer environment usage scenarios vs production: 100%
- Simulated customer environments: top 80% customers are covered
- Ability to have production-like data & content and matching configuration for top 80% customers are covered
