  - [Assumptions](./requirements.md#assumptions)
- [Solution Architecture Design](solution-architecture-design.md)
  - [Quality Attributes](./solution-architecture-design.md#solution-architecture-quality-attributes)
  - [Architecture Significant Requirements](./solution-architecture-design.md#architecture-significant-requirements)
  - [Current Architecture](./solution-architecture-design.md#current-architecture)
- Time estimation and WBS
