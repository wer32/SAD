Requirement gathering initial phase. This phase contains the next steps:
- Stakeholder list creating
- Functional requirements
- Non Functional requirements
- Constraints
- Assumptions

# Stateholder list creating
The stakeholder list creating is the required process that contains a few actions that must be done by SA. Please note that it is extremely important for the success of a project. If you talk to the incorrect stakeholders you might be faced with a situation when you are doing not the right solution. Unfortunately, this kind of case is not a rare situation.
1) Gather Solution Architecture stakeholders list - includes a technical specialist from at least one side. Like the Customer side and external team if you are working as a contractor. For instance: DevOps specialists, developers, admins, support team/s. **//todo add more roles**
2) Double check if the SA stakeholders list completed.
3) Identify a list of stakeholders for Requirements **//todo add an example**
4) Double check the second list
5) Document this list!!!

# Functional requirements
This part could have a very different format and strongly depend on the particular project. It contains what the system must do. How the system must behave or react on a runtime stimulus.

# Non Functional requirements (NFR)
NFR or quality attributes requirements. Qualification of functional requirements. All quality attributes should have measurable metrics. 

# Constraints
Document decision with zero degrees of freedom.

# Assumptions
Functional requirements, non-functional requirements, constraints that SA creates and provide in order to cover gaps in all of the above.
